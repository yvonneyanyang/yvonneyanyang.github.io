I am a first-year master's student at the School of Information Sciences [(iSchool)](https://ischool.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), specializing in Information Management and Data Science. I have a background in Health Informatics and Information Security, with a Bachelor of Science degree from [Chang Gung University](https://www.cgu.edu.tw/en). My professional experiences include a Software Test Engineer role at [MediaTek](https://www.mediatek.com/), where I contributed to smart TV firmware quality, and ongoing volunteer research at the School. 

My academic journey has been shaped by interdisciplinary interests, including natural language processing, data science, and health informatics. Notably, my undergraduate thesis focused on analyzing COVID-19's evolutionary dynamics using phylogenetic algorithms, while my capstone project involved designing a health promotion model for chronic diseases. My technical expertise spans programming languages like R, Java, and MySQL, alongside experience in Android app development and data visualization.

Outside of academics, I actively participate in leadership roles and collaborative initiatives, such as leading a cybersecurity competition team and planning community volunteer activities. With a passion for leveraging data-driven insights for real-world applications, I aim to contribute innovative solutions to challenges at the intersection of technology and society.
